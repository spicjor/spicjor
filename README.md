:wave: Hey there! I am Sergio PicÃ³ JordÃ¡, PhD student at the University of CÃ¡diz (Spain).

I study the importance of the temporal variability of the environment for the stability of animal and plant communities. To do that, I collect time series ğŸ“ˆ of natural communities to learn about what makes them persistent and stable.
